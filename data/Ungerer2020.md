## Summary

From [Ungerer (2020)](https://dataverse.no/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.18710/2YJITD): "This dataset contains response time data and participant data (nativeness, age, gender, handedness) from a structural priming experiment (N = 160) testing the link between the English caused-motion and resultative construction. The study used the "maze" variant of self-paced reading, in which participants read sentences word by word and choose between a sensible sentence continuation and a distractor word at every step."


## Variables

- `participant_ID`: ID of the experimental participant.
- `trial_number`: The trial in the experiment that the observation comes from.
- `target_cxn`: The construction in the target (`CM` for caused motion or `RES` for resultative).
- `prime_cxn`: The construction in the prime (`CM` for caused motion or `RES` for resultative).
- `verb_overlap`: Whether the prime and target contain the same verb (`yes` or `no`).
- `rt`: Response time for word choice in milliseconds.
