# Data for Summative Assessment 2

The four datasets can be found in the CSV or TSV files in this folder.
There is also a MD (markdown) file for each dataset that contains a brief summary of the study and tells you what each column in the data means.

**Choose ONE dataset and use it to address its corresponding research questions, given below.**


## The research questions

1. **BowermanSmith2022:** Are participants more likely to choose the correct object in the fixed associations condition or the random associations condition? How is this effect influenced by the experiment block?
2. **Grafmiller2023:** How does the use of 's'-genitives change from 1960 to 1990? How is this change influenced by the length of the possessum in the genitive NP?
3. **Tucker2021:** How are reaction times affected by lexical status of the target (i.e., whether or not the target item is an English word)? How is this effect influenced by the number of phones in the target?
4. **Ungerer2020:** How do reaction times change between caused-motion and resultative primes? How is this change influenced by caused-motion vs. resultative targets?
